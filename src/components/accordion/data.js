        question: "Why am I asked to confirm my email at registration?",
        answer: "We send notification of the status of delivery orders to customers as well as delivery companies. To ensure this works all the time, the email used for registration needs to be validated. At registration, a confirmation link is sent to the registered email and after confirmation, the user will be able to set a password and login to the system",

        question: "I did not get the confirmation email, what do I do? ",

        question: "Why do I need to validate my phone number? ",
        answer: " We send SMS of the status of delivery orders to registered logistics companies. To ensure this works all the time, the phone number used for registration needs to be validated. At registration, an OTP is generated and sent to the registered phone number and once the user enters the OTP, the validation of the phone number is completed and the user can now login to the system",

        question: "I did not get the OTP?",
        answer: "This happens sometimes especially due to issues with DND (Do Not Disturb) with network providers. Please contact support@dellyman.com or call 0700-DELLYMAN for assistance",
